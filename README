Introduction
============

AMQPFS is Filesystem as API that works through AMQPFS, all filesystem providers are available through AMQP bus and can be distributed
in the network.

What's the point? Why one needs this? Well, this project started as a way to integrate some third-party software while maintaining no real files or directories for them. 
For example, it could be used to serve configuration files, receive logs and such. Its use is virtually unlimited.


(Please note that AMQPFS is *very* immature at this point. Some things will definitely be changed, not all calls are implemented and I am
 sure there are at least some bugs)

Requirements
============

* Erlang R13B03
* make
* gcc
* fuse (or macfuse on Mac OS X)

Build instructions
==================

$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
$ mkdir ./amqpfs # (for default mount point)
$ make
$ make rabbit # (in a separate terminal/screen session, as it starts RabbitMQ not as a daemon)
$ make run # or
$ make run-simple # or
$ NODE=your@rabbitnode make run-mq #

Platforms Compatibilities
=========================

* Ubuntu 9.10 x86, fuse 2.7.4 (32-bit) *WORKS*
* Intel Mac OS X 10.5.8, macfuse 2.0.3 (haven't been tested for a while) *SUPPOSEDLY WORKS*
* Intel Mac OS X 10.6.2, macfuse 2.0.3-2.1.7 *DOESN'T WORK*

Examples
========

For examples, take a look at src/amqpfs_provider_base.erl, src/root_amqpfs_provider.erl, src/dot_amqpfs_provider.erl, src/mq_amqpfs_provider and tests/simple_amqpfs_provider.erl
